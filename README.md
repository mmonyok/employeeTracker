Keep track of those pesky employees, so they don't learn what a work/life balance actually is.

## Description
- I was motivated to create this application, so that I could better learn new concepts learned in class, especially MySQL queries.
- This application solves the problem of organizing large groups of people, whether that be employees, players on a team, your LAARP group, etc. Currently it is set up for organzing employees, but it could easily be retrofitted for any other need. 
- I learned a lot about MySQL queries and how to implement them via javascript and integrated through the inquirer module.
